    <title>Intro DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is what allows our JS to interact with the HTML & CSS of our page. The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser's window.
        
        DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript
        
        Two primary functions:
        1. Making a model of an HTML page
            -  when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of teh page in memory. 
            -  the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree is made of objects. 
        
        2.  Accessing and changing teh HTML page
            - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access adn update each object in teh model, which in turn updates whta the user sees in the browser.

        Usually when working with the DOM tree, we will access and element we want to work with , and then we will modify, or manipulate it. 

        ACCESSING:
            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING A SINGLE ELEMENT:
                - getElementById()
                - querySelector()
            COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:
                - querySelectorAll()
                - getElementByClassName()
                - getElementByTagName()
        MANIPULATING 
             COMMON MEHTODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT:
                - innerHTML
                - textContent
                - createElement
            COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES:
                - className / id
                - setAttribute()
                - getAttribute()

    <!--2-->  
        <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
        <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
        <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
        <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
        <h2 class="sampleClass">A h2 example</h2>

    <input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder="Your Name Here" />

    <!--We can write JavaScript directly in our html page by typing it withing a <script> tag, similar to how we would write css in a <style> tag-->
        <!-- <script>
            // now we can write some JavaScript
            console.log('Hello from the script tag~!');
        </script> -->

     <!--What if we want to use an external javascript file in this webpage?-->
         
     <script src="script.js">
